Cookie Web Demo

This is a demo for an E-commerce site using Angular for the front end and Spring Boot for the back end user databases. Users can create accounts that save their information, such as addresses, payment details, and items in their cart. To run this application, run CookieWebDemo/cookie-backend/ in a Java IDE such as Eclipse. Then install Angular and use ng serve inside the CookieWebDemo/frontend/cookie-web/ directory.
