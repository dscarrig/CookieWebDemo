Cookie Web Demo

This is a demo for an E-commerce site using Angular for the front end and Spring Boot for the back end user databases. Users can create accounts that save their information, such as addresses, payment details, and items in their cart. 

To run this app locally, cookie-backend must be run as a Spring Boot app. A Java Development Kit must be installed first. If VS code is used, the Extension Pack for Java, Spring Boot Extension Pack, and Spring Boot Dashboard need to be installed. Use the Spring Boot Dashboard to launch RestfulWebServicesApplication.

For the frontend, node.js and Angular must first be installed. First install node.js, then enter "npm install -g @angular/cli" in the command line to install Angular. Then in frontend\cookie-web, enter "npm install". Finally, enter "npm start" to start the application and navigate to the given port address.
